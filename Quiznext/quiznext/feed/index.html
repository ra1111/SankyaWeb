<p>COVID has fast-tracked the adoption of technology by schools and teachers. While it&nbsp;hasn’t&nbsp;been easy, teachers have managed to navigate all challenges by smartly adopting various tools and techniques for ensuring uninterrupted learning. ‘Interviews with Educators of the future’ is an interview series we do with different teachers to share the collective insights with the teacher community. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1403" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-300x169.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In this,&nbsp;Chaitanya Naik, Head of Product-&nbsp;QuizNext&nbsp;got into a conversation with&nbsp;<strong>Urvashi&nbsp;Khanolkar, Mathematics teacher at ASPAM Indian International School, Sharjah.</strong>&nbsp;Urvashi&nbsp;Khanolkar&nbsp;has over&nbsp;6&nbsp;years of experience and is also&nbsp;the middle-school coordinator at ASPAM school.  </p>



<p><strong>What are the challenges you uncovered after adopting online classes?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When we shifted to online classes, it was about adapting to the online platforms, understanding the&nbsp;features&nbsp;and functionalities&nbsp;and then creating protocols for online teaching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;we&nbsp;have&nbsp;used&nbsp;technology in classrooms, virtual space is completely different than being in the same room. Students think,&nbsp;behave&nbsp;and understand differently on the online platform and to gauge that gap was a challenge. Reaching and engaging students or even monitoring them to make sure that they are not feeling left out was a challenge. While it isn&#8217;t the same as being in a&nbsp;classroom; over&nbsp;a period of time, we have tried our best to bridge those gaps.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What tools or technology are you using to engage students during&nbsp;online classes?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our LMS is Microsoft Teams, however,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;conducting&nbsp;classes on Zoom, because it is better for visual communication, it helps to have everybody together on one screen via Zoom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I use Padlet to conduct discussions in the class, students share their answers or thoughts on it, then once all the students complete, as a teacher I can approve which answers to share with the rest of the class or give the necessary feedback. This helps in conducting discussions which we would have conducted orally in classrooms. I also use graphic organizers to structure thinking and to make learning more visual.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, break-out rooms on Zoom is a good feature for conducting group discussions and group activities or for assigning different tasks to certain students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have also&nbsp;used&nbsp;other&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;Quiznext,&nbsp;like Quizizz for formative assessment or for post-class validation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What do you think of formative assessments? Can they replace the summative assessments&nbsp;at least&nbsp;for&nbsp;lower grades?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In an online class setup, it is quite difficult to conduct a summative assessment. With online classes being full-time, formative assessments are a better way to conduct assessments. But in the long run, I am not sure. As per the Indian curriculum or examination system, since students are expected to write board exams, we&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;completely do away with summative assessments. As a policy, they might change the format of exam over&nbsp;a period of time, but until then,&nbsp;at least for the higher grades we can’t do away with summative assessments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For lower grades, formative assessments&nbsp;can reduce&nbsp;the pressure and help them focus less on memorizing and more on applying. At our school, we conduct formative assessments every Thursday or when we finish a chapter, whichever is more feasible for teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What aspects of online learning will you carry into classrooms once the&nbsp;lockdown ends?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Our classrooms are equipped with a smartboard, but with online learning, I have&nbsp;realized&nbsp;that&nbsp;technology usage could be increased further to make learning effective. Once we resume regular school, we may introduce BYOD in our classrooms,&nbsp;which can further integrate technology in day-to-day learning.&nbsp;</li><li>Online classes offer transparency and access to resources. For instance, today on MS Teams, my students have access to all my class resources like PowerPoint presentations, notes, assignments and at times, class recordings. Even if&nbsp;someone&nbsp;misses classes, they can pick up from there. Everything is documented and there is transparency. Even if parents want to access them, it is&nbsp;available. This improves overall communication; this is something I would like to continue even after the classes&nbsp;resume&nbsp;as normal.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Lastly, I have realized a lot of work especially assignments can go paperless and could be done with online tools. This could be a good jump especially for Indian curriculum schools on their journey towards paperless classrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Have the teacher communities become more active post COVID? In the US, teacher communities have been active both online and offline, do you see this happening in&nbsp;the&nbsp;ME?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In the Middle East, with respect to teacher communities, I suppose we are somewhere between the US and India. We have a very active teacher community here, but&nbsp;it hasn’t&nbsp;been as prolific as the ones in the US with a big online presence. Even pre-COVID, we would&nbsp;have teacher&nbsp;meetups, workshops and conferences where we would get to interact and learn from other teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But then, we were bound by time and space. Now online webinars have&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;avenues for frequent meetups. Pre- COVID, if there would be meetups once a month, now probably we have one every week. Also, teaching online is a challenge, so people want to talk about it and learn from each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Could&nbsp;you&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us more about the hybrid model that ASPAM Indian International school plans to experiment with?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Starting October ‘20, depending on the situation, we plan to start the hybrid model, where we will have few students come to the school and others learn online. This a small step towards resuming face-to-face classes; it will help the high school students to attend their lab sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;not a mandatory thing, parents have the option of whether to send students to school or not. We conducted a survey with our parent community, there were about 10-15 percent parents per class who were willing to send kids to school. So, we plan to start small and once parents see it working and feel more confident about how we are doing, we expect more parents to start sending their kids to school. Eventually, if there are more students willing to come to school, we will do this on a rotational basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will be teaching with smart boards, that would be streamed over Zoom for students attending classes&nbsp;online.&nbsp;When&nbsp;it comes to activities, we plan to have some&nbsp;hands-on&nbsp;ones for students in the class while&nbsp;those&nbsp;attending online will do them with a web-tool. It is a little bit challenging, but we will adapt to it as we did with online classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TeacherInterviews-3-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1388" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TeacherInterviews-3-1024x576.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TeacherInterviews-3-300x169.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TeacherInterviews-3-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The year 2020 will be etched in history as the “Online Educational Era”. As idealistic as it sounds, it comes with its own comebacks. It has been a huge change to get used to and we at QuizNext were curious to know how our users were adapting to the present conditions. Chaitanya Naik, Head of Product- QuizNext got into a telephonic conversation with two educators who have used QuizNext and benefited positively.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava,</strong> Principal of Sahu International School, is a Biology teacher who has over twenty-two years of experience teaching classes nine and ten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our second interviewee was <strong>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop</strong> from the Chemistry Department in Sushila Birla Girls School, Kolkata who has over fifteen years of experience in her field of education.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong><em>If you look at your 1st day of online classes to today what changes have you seen?</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava: “<em>The first day was quite an anxious day for teachers and students. Web Cameras, screen sharing, managing noises in multiple environments were some of the problems we had initially. Now as time has passed we have gotten in the flow of things. As teachers, we discuss how we can explain things in a better manner and engage children online. Now when we look back, these issues were quite trivia</em>l”.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop: “<em>Initially classes were quite chaotic. Now they are much more organized and settled in. Students also learned to accept the changed way of teaching. They have adopted the new learning processes and now enjoy the class and the different methods used and parents also have opened up for all required help</em>”.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong><em>What are the challenges you uncovered after adopting online classes?</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava: “<em>I personally have almost 22 years experience teaching in a classroom. It was very hard for myself and other faculty members to replicate our classroom teaching. Normally in a classroom, we are able to read the faces and body language of children and figure out if they are paying attention or not. Sometimes in online classes, we may be speaking for 10-15 minutes straight. By the end of the class, we feel alone. In order to make sure students are listening all the way, we conduct a test by the end of the class. In this aspect, QuizNext has helped a lot. The results of online classes were turning up very disappointing. With QuizNext, we were able to get ready-made Quizzes on the topics we just covered and put the student’s knowledge to the test.</em>”<br></p>



<p>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop: “<em>Extensive use of technology, discovering new ways to engage students and maintaining their interest in the topic, managing parents and adopting the changing rules of the board about conducting online classes. These are just a few of the changes we had to come around since online classes began</em>”.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think formative assessment can replace exams this year?&nbsp;</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava: “<em>I am not certain about it. Teachers like it. Students like it. It gives a clearer image of the student’s knowledge. It took a while though. We started off slow and now we conduct 3-5 quizzes on each chapter with Quiznext. Formative Assessments are reliable for giving students all year round engagement to their studies. Replacing final exams might be too big a change right now. Even NEP 2020 is going for a similar system. So we will have to wait and watch</em>”.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop: “<em>Maybe. Formative assessments definitely have their own way of testing the talents of children. The future will be bright for those students who can apply their knowledge and not just who gather the information</em>”.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>What aspects of online learning will you carry into classrooms once the lockdown ends?</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava: “<em>We started off using technology due to compulsion. There wasn’t any other way. Now we see the benefits of it. The quizzes, videos and content has definitely been beneficial for students after classes. Since children are actively participating in it, we will continue to adopt the benefits of technology further. We will continue using QuizNext even after school is opened for daily formative assessment</em>”.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop: “<em>Online quizzes, sharing relevant videos, online examination as it is the upcoming trend and of course , the webinars. These are a few of the features we will carry into the offline mode of learning as well</em>”.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong><em>Now that you are not seeing students in person, what has changed for you in terms of bond/connection with students?</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava: “<em>We all teachers share a special bond with our students. To the point where children listen to us more than their parents. Even though we don&#8217;t see each other physically, we managed to maintain that bond. We exchange WhatsApp messages. Students ask more questions offline. Being at home, when online classes happen, students treat us teachers like guests in their home. In the first video call with the students, I could see the joy on their face. They were excited to see us after their long break. We are quite excited to see them after the lockdown is lifted. I am sure that day will be emotional for the staff. We miss talking to the parents as well</em>”.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop: “<em>Nothing in terms of bond has really changed. This generation is more open on an online platform than they are personally. This period gave us an opportunity to come onto the same platform and realise their way of thinking and expressing. It has really brought us closer. In my last 15 years of teaching experience, it was always that I had just one or two students contact number or email id of class 12 for any communication or information sharing. But this year not of only class 12 , I have contact numbers, WhatsApp numbers and email ids of all my students right from class 6 to 12.</em>”<br></p>



<p>While the online era might have its drawbacks, we have to try and make the best out of the present situation and find what is best for the future of the coming generations of children.The pandemic might have been a step back but adapting to the present situation will be taking two steps forward. <br></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Developed in 1885 by German Psychologist Herman Ebbinghaus, the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve is a concept which tells us about the recall rate of the human mind. Herman Ebbinghaus tested this concept by writing down a list of consonant-vowel-consonant words. These kinds of words are known today as &#8220;nonsense syllables&#8221; because they make no meaning at all. Examples of nonsense syllables are DAX, BOK, and YAT. He wrote down a total of 23,000 words like this and learnt all of them. Over time, he checked how many of these words he could recall. He was able to recall words lesser and lesser over time. With each passing day, his memory of the list was going lower and lower. That is when he came up with a graph to understand the pattern of his decaying memory.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vX3mGs-gKaGXFI8Dj2NPryWm8bGZTcCENnDEf47Hv9URKlL4RHMXqBkYvNeWntBKlJWCGAySswh2tRQi6wA0-2sN6Dv1JGVB21wD2ukSTpr6ntz--DnvhdSJrnPsFw0e59MPDT1b" alt=""/></figure>



<p class="has-small-font-size">Source: Praveen Shrestha, &#8220;Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve,&#8221; in <em>Psychestudy</em>, November 17, 2017, <a href="https://www.psychestudy.com/cognitive/memory/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve">https://www.psychestudy.com/cognitive/memory/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve</a>.<br></p>



<p></p>



<p>From this graph, he understood that the amount of knowledge retained for the first few days after the learning drops steeply. After that steep drop, it&#8217;s obvious that Ebbingaus was able to remember the same nonsense syllables that he remembered the day before. What this means is that by revisiting or reviewing what we learnt from time to time will help us not to forget it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kidsforget-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1383" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kidsforget-1.jpg 750w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kidsforget-1-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p>If there is someone’s memory that you are in awe of, they have probably learned to tackle the&nbsp; Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve. Before getting into ways to get over the curve we have to understand the concept of forgetting. The rate of forgetting is simply the time period in which the mind forgets the learned information. The factors which influence the rate of forgetting within a mind are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Poor representation of the information</li><li>The establishment of meaning behind the information</li><li>Physiological elements such as sleep and stress</li></ul>



<p>A common misconception is cramming will help. This is absolutely not true. Things stay fresh in our minds in the initial stages and it is a must to cement things at that time. When you cram one day before a deadline your mind is able to only retain fifty to sixty percent of what you learn at the time and this leads to poor results. This is why it is important to start on in the initial stages of learning something.<br></p>



<p>A simple hack to render the curve as redundant is spaced repetition. Spaced Repetition is a method of learning that was developed to ensure that information is retained in one’s mind by consistent reviewing and revising in set intervals. This learning technique takes into account the psychological spacing effect. If you review the matter too early, you would be wasting time, and if you review it too late it becomes less reviewing and more studying again. The best way to know when to review something is when you can recollect 85% of the subject matter. That is when it is a good time to review. This is a scientifically proven way to store information in our memory for a longer time.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>For example, imagine you have attended an hour-long session. Once you reach back home your mind is still fresh with all the points from the session. This is when you should try finding trigger points that will help you remember the session in parts. Suppose you remember three trigger points that recall twenty minutes of the session, this cumulates to the one hour of the session. Now in order to make sure the information from the session is imprinted in your mind, all you need to do is recall these trigger points every night before sleeping. This activity won’t go on for more than twenty minutes and will benefit your memory in the long run.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>While no student is expected to remember nonsense words like DAX, BOK, and YAT there are much more trying and harder concepts like friction, velocity and grammar that need to be conquered. Another way of making sure these don’t slip from one’s mind is by learning to understand. Mindless memorization comes with its own problems. If the question is presented in an application, blind memorization will fail you. For this reason, it is important to understand what you are studying. An easy way of doing this is practicing application based questions which will give a better idea of what the concept is. No matter how well versed you are in a concept, it is human nature for it to slip your mind. This is why revision and practice is very important. If you are not well versed in a particular concept , practice is much more crucial.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The major takeaway from this is consistency and revision is key. Students tend to have to remember many things on a daily basis. This can create a lot of chaos in the study process. Which is why consistent practise and revision will gravely benefit them. The difficulty comes in staying consistent and making sure that the right revision is carried out.</p>



<p>This is where stellar platforms like <em>QuizNext</em> enter the picture. With QuizNext, your child will have a consistent and well-curated revision schedule that will be time-efficient and tailored to each and every user. Most E-Learning platforms focus on long hours of studies. QuizNext, on the other hand, focuses on consistency. Its AI-based remembering algorithm determines a student&#8217;s forgetting curve across various subjects and creates a study plan that helps kids to tackle the forgetting curve. With its Revise+ feature, you can rest assured that your child is getting the perfect practice and not succumbing to the forgetting curve.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In conclusion, overcoming the forgetting curve is quite easy. All we need to do is have a constant revision schedule that is made efficient with trigger points and important topics.<br></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Practice is key to Mastery. Before Sachin Tendulkar became the first man to score a double century in the 2014 Men’s ODI, he spent ten hours in the nets practicing. While preparing for the chess championship, Magnus Carlsen would play a minimum of ten professional chess players blindfolded. Dhyan Chand would run through the crowded markets of Mumbai with his stick and ball making sure the ball does not touch anyone, which gave him the dribbling skills of a God. This might make it look like only sports require practice but that is not the case. Each and everything that needs to be mastered involves hours and hours of practice.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/practice-1024x708.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1347" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/practice-1024x708.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/practice-300x207.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/practice-768x531.png 768w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/practice.png 1066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Practice tips that students can learn from successful sportspersons</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A more relatable example would be the CBSE toppers in India. Everyone credited many different things and people for their success but one thing every topper had in common was the importance they gave to practice.</strong> To see the other tips CBSE 10th Grade Toppers had to say, <a href="https://quiznext.in/5-tips-and-tricks-from-cbse-x-grade-2020-toppers/"><em>click here</em></a>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>A common misconception is that practice is the same as hard work.</strong> This is not the case. Hard work is the high amount of blood, sweat and toil that goes into doing a task for the first few times. The practice is what makes the same task easier as time passes. The more one practices, the easier the task gets. Our brains are just like the other muscles of our bodies. If we do not keep using them, they will become useless. Practising is what keeps our brains fresh and functional. Often practice is the repetition of the same task again and again. Scientists believe this unlocks our mind to use its muscle memory, which is when our mind is able to come up with solutions to a problem purely from memory. Most athletes tap into their muscle memory due to hours and hours of practice. Practice can be counterproductive if not done in the right way as well. Some points to remember when practising are listed below.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>1. Focus when engaged in the practice</strong></p>



<p>While practice in its essence is the repetition of familiar concepts, again and again, it is key to be focussed throughout the process. Unfocussed practice leads to mindless memorization, which is counterproductive. Staying focussed in realising the areas which need more work on.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>2. Minimize distractions</strong></p>



<p>The only way one’s focus can be brought down is by distractions. A common practice that should be distracted is studying near a window. The changing scenery tends to be a common distraction. Some other distractions that can be removed are studying around novels, household noises, music, flashy and bright room colours etc.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>3. Start slow and increase speed later</strong></p>



<p>Like most things in life, practice takes time to get used to. You could even say practising takes practice. For this reason, it is important to not overburden every practice session. The point of practice is to make present concepts solid, not fill your brains to the brim with how much ever you can. There’s no harm in starting slowly and then picking up the pace gradually. This way your mind goes through the transition gradually and doesn’t face a sudden spike.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>4. Practice repeatedly with frequent breaks</strong></p>



<p>Intense practice sessions tend to wear the mind. This is why they should be kept as small as possible. It is easier to focus the mind for small sessions than long ones. Small focussed sessions are much more proverbial than long unfocused sessions. Taking a break in between has no harm to one’s progress. It keeps the mind fresh and sharp.<br></p>



<p><strong>5. Visualize to help reinforce the practice</strong></p>



<p>It goes with saying that our eyes are one of the strongest senses that guide us through life. Researchers and Scientists have proven that education with visual stimulation is much more effective than any other form of education. Visualization is a guaranteed method of making a mental image of the concept which helps in retaining information for longer.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The problem with practice is monotony. The repetition of the same task, again and again, can be quite boring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should not be a problem with <em>QuizNext</em>. QuizNext users tend to practice three times more than average students. With QuizNext’s bite-sized practice sessions, students are kept engaged for small periods of time and get the best practice. With its gamified quizzes and holistic approach to practice, QuizNext is the best platform for students to get practice.<br></p>



<p>No level of mastery of something can stop the practice. There is always a higher level to get on. The way to get there is constant practice. In this dog eat dog world, there is only one way to keep yourself ahead of the edge, and that is practice. As the saying goes “Practice makes Perfection”.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">The world has now become dynamic, every second brings a new change. Be it new technology, unprecedented crisis or simple policy changes. You can never truly be prepared for the future. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LookBeyondVideo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1310" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LookBeyondVideo.png 686w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LookBeyondVideo-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></figure>



<p><br></p>



<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color">Even before the stay-at-home era began, ed-tech had found its place at home, however, COVID has accelerated the pace at which the schools have started embracing technology. Before the pandemic, though schools had exposed students to educational aids like Smart Class, Smart Boards and other Interactive learning aids, the rate of adoption had been slow.  <br>But now schools across the country have started adopting online class aids, assessment tools, community portals, virtual groups and many other aids e-learning has to offer. Though pandemic came as a great shock to the schools, the schools have thriftily adopted technology in the right areas. The pandemic has also got the best teachers online, several teachers are recording their lectures and posting them on YouTube for free<br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>&#8220;Online classes are much more organized and settled now, students have accepted the changed way of teaching- learning process. They enjoy the class because of the use of different methods and even parents have opened up for all required help&#8221; says Amrita Gaur Swaroop, HOD- Chemistry, Sushila Birla School when asked about how things have changed compared to the initial days of online classes.</p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Also, pandemic and online classes have compelled schools to embrace formative assessments. Gone are the days when the only form of evaluation was summative assessments. Platforms like Quiznext have made formative assessments possible for schools. QuizNext has turned homework into small bite-sized practice sessions that make homework less of a task and more leisure. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>We started using technology as we had no other choice, now we are seeing some benefits. When things get better and schools re-open, we will definitely continue to share more videos and content with students. We are demonstrating experiments using items we can easily find at home, and students find it more interesting and they are trying on own. We will continue to engage students using this kind of activities even after we get back to normal&#8221; says Sunita Srivastava, Principal, Sahu International School.</p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">With the classes, homework and assessments going online even parents have been able to get a detailed analysis of the student&#8217;s performances instead of subjective feedbacks like in PTMs. However, one area of worry for parents has certainly been the increased screentime, <a href="https://quiznext.in/screen-time-how-much-is-too-much-learning-edtech-app/">that has more than doubled during the pandemic. </a> While taking online classes has become inevitable, parents have started reducing the negative screentime of their kids. This has created a spike in the users looking for apps that offer bite-sized practice sessions such as Quiznext and Quizlet.  <br></p>



<p>Instead of rejecting the new change, all stakeholders have learned to embrace it. The only way we can lead a happy life is by accepting the situation and making the best out of it. As the saying goes, “The only thing certain is uncertainty”. <br></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, the man who invented the devices we are slaves to, never let his children close to an iPad. Melinda Gates regrets giving mobile phones to her children after they became teenagers and wishes she had waited longer. In these times when the entire world functions on a screen it is hard to boycott technology completely. It is also wrong to give into them completely. This particular matter cannot be looked at in a black or white way.&nbsp; This is why we have to find a grey area.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-2-1024x727.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1304" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-2-1024x727.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-2-300x213.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-2-768x545.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In a study conducted in London, it was observed that people between the ages of eleven to twenty-four, spend two and a half hours in front of their computer, three hours in front of their phone and two hours in front of the television. That totals to seven and a half hours in front of a screen. That is almost one-third of a day spent in front of a screen. This is not very healthy for the children. In such cases, parents were told to cap their time in front of a screen and spend time away from the screen as well. Thus finding a balance in front of the screen and off-screen as well.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Ever since the pandemic has begun, due to social distancing, schools have closed and all classes are being carried out online. This has almost doubled the screen time for most school-going children. In such a situation, the child is sitting in front of a screen cannot be considered negative as they are learning something that is part of their education and thus it cannot be avoided. It is hard for most parents to send their kids out to play at this time as well. In such situations, how to manage a child’s screen time while being a parent?&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The first thing to do would be to monitor the amount of positive and negative screen time. Negative screen time is spending time in front of a screen for recreational purposes. If a child is spending more than three hours negative screen time, they need to reduce it. Even though there is no scope for outdoor activities, children can pick up new habits like meditation and breathing exercises. Household chores like arranging the bookshelf or cleaning the house can be quite therapeutic as well.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>With <em>QuizNext</em>, you can be assured that your child is having 100% positive and engaging screen time. <em>QuizNext </em>offers tailored practice sessions that are fun and educational as well and make sure your child is up to date with their syllabus and revision.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Now even if a child uses all their screen time positively, it could damage their eyes and other body parts as well. With other video-based learning apps, students are expected to sit for a minimum of sixty minutes. After sitting for hours in front of a screen for school, this can be quite harmful to a child’s eyes. This is a common concern voiced by most parents.<br></p>



<p>At <em>QuizNext</em>, it is an unspoken understanding that the student’s health comes first. Which is why, after an intense and engaging practice session of a maximum fifteen minutes, the student is expected to take a break where they are not looking at a screen. This way the student there is no continuous strain on the eyes. In a mere twenty-five minutes session in front of a screen, the student is set for the day. QuizNext believes inconsistency and not long hours. It ensures that children practice the right chapters and the right questions with a personalised study plan. This way children receive the best of their syllabus in the least time possible.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Schools have been asked to adopt the “10-10 rule” or the “20-20 rule”. The FICCI ARISE (Alliance for Re-Imagining School Education) organised a webinar on “Good Screen Time v/s Bad Screen Time”, to make a fair assessment of the nature and need of online learning. In this webinar, Parul Sharma introduced these rules. In its essence, schools should conduct classes where students will be taught for twenty minutes and then they will have to keep their eyes closed for twenty minutes. This drastically reduces the damage done by the blue light emitted by the screens and reduces the stress on the eyes.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In a world where everything is on a screen, it is foolish to figure out a way to avoid screens altogether. It is also foolish to become their slaves. This is why you have to find the balance and keep yourself in check. A little bit of control will take us a long way.&nbsp;<br></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The biggest challenge of an educator or a parent is to keep their child’s attention focussed on the hand at task. In a world where every new gizmo is programmed to be a distraction, it is very hard for one not to be distracted and unfocused. This tends to hinder the progress of a task. Even though the next big distraction comes in a new form and distracts in a new way, there are some simple and standard ways to improve the concentration of a child.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AttentionDeficit-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1271" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AttentionDeficit-1.png 1000w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AttentionDeficit-1-300x199.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AttentionDeficit-1-768x510.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Time to Time Attention Checks</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Children tend to get lost in their own thoughts especially while learning from videos or even during the live classes. No matter how engaging or animated the videos are, the reality is that they fail to hold the attention because students do not get a sense of being part of the activity and are just passively watching. In a class of thirty minutes, the teacher asks students questions every five minutes to hold their attention. This way the student knows the consequences of not paying attention and hence will be focussed the entire time.  Now the video learning apps lack these triggers and hence don&#8217;t work very effectively for kids. However, as a parent, an easy way to tackle this is by checking in on the child every once in a while. <br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Remove Visual Distractions&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>As the saying goes “The mind goes where the eyes wander”. If there are things that might visually stimulate a child, it needs to be removed from the environment of the task. This is why parents are urged not to keep the study table adjacent to a window as the scene outside the window might be distracting. Flashing colours, posters, changing screensavers on computer screens/smartboards etc. are a few visual distractions that can be dealt with in a classroom.<br></p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;<strong>Make the task as fun as possible</strong></li></ul>



<p>A common reason for an attention deficit child to get distracted is the nature of the task. They find it either drab or boring and don’t feel the need to pay attention during the course of the task. Classes cannot stop because of this, but it definitely can have a small twist. Maybe a class conducted outside.&nbsp; A quiz where students compete against each other. A game where everyone gets to participate and the lecture doesn’t feel like a lecture anymore. This keeps students engaged and focussed.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>With <em>QuizNext’s</em> gamified quizzes, children not only get their well-needed practice and revision but also have fun doing it. Users report that they feel they are able to go on for long hours of practice with <em>QuizNext</em> thanks to its fun and user-friendly interface.&nbsp;<br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Fix a routine</strong></li></ul>



<p>This is key to correcting issues in regard to attention and focus. In a fixed routine, there is a designated time for each and everything. That includes important tasks, break times and recreational activities. On knowing that there is a fixed time for everything, children are able to give their one hundred per cent to a task at the specified time. This is a very beneficial way of tackling attention and focus issues.&nbsp;<br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Tailoring lessons/tasks to children’s strengths</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Every child has their own method of learning and understanding things. Some need visual cues like diagrams, flashcards, charts etc. Some need audio cues like shared reading, musical lessons etc. Some need kinaesthetic lessons which enable them to touch and feel their subject matter like application-based projects, dioramas etc. Tailoring the tasks and lessons to the likes of the student makes the student focus on the task with interest.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Set Up a Reward System&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>Studies have shown that at a young age, children tend to work best for incentive. Doesn’t change much when you grow up either, does it? For this simple reason, it is best if a reward system is established before the task begins. The reward could be grand at the end of the task or it could be small rewards at the end of every subtask. It is a very easy and efficient way of making sure the student doesn’t lose focus on their path to earn the rewards.</p>



<p>QuizNext offers practice in the most rewarding way. Along with having fun and amazing gamified quizzes, students really gear up to reap the benefits of topping the leaderboard and are always working hard to maintain their positions.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Embrace the Distractions&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>This might seem to go against the above six points but it is essential to understand this tricky situation. The task we want a child to do is what they need to do. The distraction is what they want to do. It is essential for them to understand they can do whatever they want once they are done with doing what they need to do. For example, after an hour of homework, they could watch T.V. for half an hour. Their distraction could be their reward for their undivided attention during their studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>QuizNext solely believes in the focussed study. After some engaging quizzes and practice sessions, the app advises the user to take a break. This way the student is well rested and can hop back on the app for more gamified fun sessions.</p>



<p>“A child is not a plate to be filled, but a lamp to be lit”. Occasionally the flame of the lamp might waiver but it is the job of the educator to make sure the flame stays lit. As a child gets ready to face the real world, there are many distractions he/she will face and these are a few ways they can learn to keep them focussed.&nbsp;<br></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As of 15 July, the Batch of 2020 is celebrating their results in the confines of their homes during these harsh times. Some have much more to celebrate, as finally, all their hard work has paid off and they have emerged at the top of the ranks in these board exams. Though most people in India would like to believe that these children are slogging and cramming for long hours to achieve their goals, they are all-rounders and have passions in fields outside of academics. What could be their secrets to cracking this exam?&nbsp; Listed below are five tips that are coming straight from the toppers of the CBSE 10th Board Exams of various years.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-1-1-1024x727.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1259" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-1-1-1024x727.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-1-1-300x213.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-1-1-768x545.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. Consistency is Key</strong><br></p>



<p>If there is one thing that is common with all the toppers of the exams, it is a fixed schedule containing a fixed amount of time for self-study, revision, recreational activities. It is important to set goals and not study hours. There were students who topped their exams with five hours of self-study and there were students who needed ten hours a day. The common element was that they dedicated a set amount of time everyday for self-study irrespective of what. On average, most toppers did 4-5 hours of daily study. If there is a topic you have understood it is a must to revisit the topic infrequent intervals. This is done to keep the concept fresh in the mind. This is the reason all toppers had a dedicated amount of time for self-study and revision everyday.<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. Keep it simple and focus on the Right Topics&nbsp;</strong><br></p>



<p>The syllabus of the Board Exams has been summarized and explained in the best possible way in NCERT textbooks. In the list of recommended books that come from CBSE, the topper of that list has always been NCERT textbooks. Every topper vouches for these textbooks and says that it is a must to know the textbook inside out about each subject before going for any other references. Most questions are based on topics covered by NCERT textbooks. Understanding and mastering application of every concept of the textbook is the key to cracking the board exams.&nbsp; </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Barsha Chatterjee (98%,&nbsp; CBSE X Grade Board Exams 2020), said in her interview with <em>Hindustan Times</em> “Don’t take any short-cuts. I studied only from the NCERT books and didn’t even consult any reference books. Teachers were of great help.”<br></p></blockquote>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Practice makes Perfect</strong><br></p>



<p>Khanak Patwari (99.2%, CBSE X Grade Board Exams 2020) said the key to her success was the providing of regular worksheets, tests and practice sessions that helped him crack this exam. As we have seen, toppers do not spend long hours in their studies but study for an average of four hours. Looking at the size of the syllabus this might seem impossible but the key to this is to approach your studies smartly. This can be done by studying and mastering important concepts first. The key to understanding what is important is by going through the previous year’s question papers and sample papers. Focussing on the recurring concepts gives you an edge over students who spent time on concepts that might not be as important. Most toppers credited their teachers for showing these areas of focus. <br></p>



<p>With the help of AI, <em>QuizNext</em> offers practice sessions on each concept based on student improvement areas, concept weights and previous question papers. This way the user has a thorough revision of all the concepts. It is like having a personal coach at all times. <em>QuizNext</em> users tend to cover three times more topics than a student going through a question bank. Quiznext’s worksheets are personalised based on the most important thing the student needs to practice.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. Micro but Focussed Study Sessions</strong><br></p>



<p>Monotony is what leads to most students giving up on their studies. This is why most toppers had something that broke this monotony and helped them keep their mind fresh and focussed. While Aadit Latike (99.6%, CBSE X Grade Board Exams 2020) was a fine academic, he loved playing Badminton every once in a while and was a very talented Pianist and won the national level accolades. <br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In her interview with <em>Hindustan Times</em>, P. Harini (499/500,&nbsp; CBSE X Grade Board Exams 2020) said “I was never too harsh on myself and I took breaks whenever I felt like I deserved it. I never forced myself to study because I knew I wouldn’t be able to concentrate efficiently”. </p></blockquote>



<p>During these breaks, P.Harini would listen to music and watch T.V. Four hours of study with concentration is much more effective than ten hours of study without concentration.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>With QuizNext’s gamified practice sessions, you are kept engaged for usually fifteen minutes of focussed gamified quizzes after which you can take the break that you deserve. This keeps the mind fresh and engaged.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. Fear, An Unnecessary Crippler</strong><br></p>



<p>It is human to be scared of exams but it is an absolute must to make sure this fear does not affect your performance during an exam. Keeping a cool mind is a must. Fear will lead to a spiral that will affect the answers. As long as you have prepared smartly there is no way you will walk out of an exam with your head down.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Following a fixed revision plan and knowing all the important topics and concepts gives a sense of confidence that cannot be competed with. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Summed perfectly by Bhuvi Kansal (495/500,&nbsp; CBSE X Grade Board Exams 2020) “Staying stress-free and being regular with exams is what worked for me”.<br></p></blockquote>



<p>With <em>Quiznext</em>, students get personalised study plans that are backed with data and are generated and modified dynamically based on student mastery. For instance, a student might need revision for a concept in Chemistry within two weeks, but for another concept in Physics, the revision would be required only after six weeks, because the student would have understood it very well. Quiznext study plans take into account student performances to ensure continuous revision, after all, continuous revision is what makes exams stress free. The best part is that Quiznext recommended revision plans only take about twenty to thirty minutes every day.</p>



<p>In conclusion, it is possible to ace the CBSE exam with flying colours if you follow these easy tips. At the end of the day, exams are just small hurdles to be crossed. With a little discipline and compromise, you will find yourself on the road to success in a blink of an eye.<br></p>

<p>The coronavirus outbreak has forced schools to assess their options for educating remotely, considering that school could reopen only by September. This uncertainty has put to the test a school&#8217;s preparedness, its readiness to adapt and the principal&#8217;s agility for technology adoption to ensure continued learning. </p>



<p>Though the school management is increasingly concerned about what the upcoming academic year would look like, the truth is it is easier than they think. Here are the three simple steps schools can adopt to make their classes online, yet make it fun and effective, more importantly at zero budget.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Exception-as-e-1024x479.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1072" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Exception-as-e-1024x479.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Exception-as-e-300x140.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Exception-as-e-768x359.png 768w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Exception-as-e.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>3 simple steps for schools to take their classes &#8216;live&#8217; with zero budget<br><br></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Teaching</strong></p>



<p>The schools should look to use any of the tools available off the shelf for teaching, rather than looking at a comprehensive live teaching platform meant for educational institutes. For instance, adopting a full-fledged LMS takes anywhere between 3 and 6 weeks and will require content creation, teacher training, student id generations and so on. But &#8216;Plug and Play&#8217; tools, not only works out to be cheaper but also extremely simpler and faster to set up and use.</p>



<p>Tools like Zoom, Google Meet (Hangout) or even Youtube should help you get started. You can get started for free with these tools and when you utilize the free-limits, they don&#8217;t cost the school more than Rs. 800- 3,000 per month. </p>



<p>After the live classes, schools should make the recorded videos available on YouTube, so that students can go back to them later. Or, teachers could find other supporting videos on YouTube and share them with students.</p>



<p><strong>Homework, Practice and Assessment</strong></p>



<p>After teaching the second aspect is to assign students homework and allow them to practice the chapters. Platforms like <a href="https://bit.ly/2Wqr6Vl">Quiznext </a>help schools to do this with zero effort and cost. Quiznext already comes with over 2.5 lakh questions in the form of quizzes, worksheets and other interactive formats that students can go and practice. It is a gamified practice platform that engages and motivates students to practice more by using the game elements. It is 100% aligned with CBSE &amp; ICSE curriculum and is available for Maths &amp; Science for Classes 6- 10.</p>



<p>It is being used by students from over 1,400 schools and is trusted by 85,000+ parents.</p>



<p><strong>Doubt Clearing</strong></p>



<p>The last element involved in teaching is clarifying the doubts of students. Now, this could also be done through Quiznext. Quiznext allows students to share their doubts with teachers via Whatsapp and email. Based on the doubts received from students, in the subsequent classes teachers could spend time clarifying their doubts.</p>



<p>&#8216;Quiznext for Classrooms&#8217; comes with a dashboard for teachers that provides insights to teachers on students&#8217; performance, improvement areas and key concepts that would require revision. Quiznext also allows teachers to conduct live Quizzes on specific chapters, that not just makes practice fun for students but also offers learning insights for teachers. Setting up &#8216;Quiznext for Classrooms&#8217; will not take more than two hours and is just an email away. </p>
