				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, the man who invented the devices we are slaves to, never let his children close to an iPad. Melinda Gates regrets giving mobile phones to her children after they became teenagers and wishes she had waited longer. In these times when the entire world functions on a screen it is hard to boycott technology completely. It is also wrong to give into them completely. This particular matter cannot be looked at in a black or white way.&nbsp; This is why we have to find a grey area.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-2-1024x727.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1304" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-2-1024x727.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-2-300x213.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blue-and-Yellow-Thumbs-Up-Congratulations-Card-2-768x545.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In a study conducted in London, it was observed that people between the ages of eleven to twenty-four, spend two and a half hours in front of their computer, three hours in front of their phone and two hours in front of the television. That totals to seven and a half hours in front of a screen. That is almost one-third of a day spent in front of a screen. This is not very healthy for the children. In such cases, parents were told to cap their time in front of a screen and spend time away from the screen as well. Thus finding a balance in front of the screen and off-screen as well.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Ever since the pandemic has begun, due to social distancing, schools have closed and all classes are being carried out online. This has almost doubled the screen time for most school-going children. In such a situation, the child is sitting in front of a screen cannot be considered negative as they are learning something that is part of their education and thus it cannot be avoided. It is hard for most parents to send their kids out to play at this time as well. In such situations, how to manage a child’s screen time while being a parent?&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The first thing to do would be to monitor the amount of positive and negative screen time. Negative screen time is spending time in front of a screen for recreational purposes. If a child is spending more than three hours negative screen time, they need to reduce it. Even though there is no scope for outdoor activities, children can pick up new habits like meditation and breathing exercises. Household chores like arranging the bookshelf or cleaning the house can be quite therapeutic as well.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>With <em>QuizNext</em>, you can be assured that your child is having 100% positive and engaging screen time. <em>QuizNext </em>offers tailored practice sessions that are fun and educational as well and make sure your child is up to date with their syllabus and revision.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Now even if a child uses all their screen time positively, it could damage their eyes and other body parts as well. With other video-based learning apps, students are expected to sit for a minimum of sixty minutes. After sitting for hours in front of a screen for school, this can be quite harmful to a child’s eyes. This is a common concern voiced by most parents.<br></p>



<p>At <em>QuizNext</em>, it is an unspoken understanding that the student’s health comes first. Which is why, after an intense and engaging practice session of a maximum fifteen minutes, the student is expected to take a break where they are not looking at a screen. This way the student there is no continuous strain on the eyes. In a mere twenty-five minutes session in front of a screen, the student is set for the day. QuizNext believes inconsistency and not long hours. It ensures that children practice the right chapters and the right questions with a personalised study plan. This way children receive the best of their syllabus in the least time possible.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Schools have been asked to adopt the “10-10 rule” or the “20-20 rule”. The FICCI ARISE (Alliance for Re-Imagining School Education) organised a webinar on “Good Screen Time v/s Bad Screen Time”, to make a fair assessment of the nature and need of online learning. In this webinar, Parul Sharma introduced these rules. In its essence, schools should conduct classes where students will be taught for twenty minutes and then they will have to keep their eyes closed for twenty minutes. This drastically reduces the damage done by the blue light emitted by the screens and reduces the stress on the eyes.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In a world where everything is on a screen, it is foolish to figure out a way to avoid screens altogether. It is also foolish to become their slaves. This is why you have to find the balance and keep yourself in check. A little bit of control will take us a long way.&nbsp;<br></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The biggest challenge of an educator or a parent is to keep their child’s attention focussed on the hand at task. In a world where every new gizmo is programmed to be a distraction, it is very hard for one not to be distracted and unfocused. This tends to hinder the progress of a task. Even though the next big distraction comes in a new form and distracts in a new way, there are some simple and standard ways to improve the concentration of a child.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AttentionDeficit-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1271" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AttentionDeficit-1.png 1000w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AttentionDeficit-1-300x199.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AttentionDeficit-1-768x510.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Time to Time Attention Checks</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Children tend to get lost in their own thoughts especially while learning from videos or even during the live classes. No matter how engaging or animated the videos are, the reality is that they fail to hold the attention because students do not get a sense of being part of the activity and are just passively watching. In a class of thirty minutes, the teacher asks students questions every five minutes to hold their attention. This way the student knows the consequences of not paying attention and hence will be focussed the entire time.  Now the video learning apps lack these triggers and hence don&#8217;t work very effectively for kids. However, as a parent, an easy way to tackle this is by checking in on the child every once in a while. <br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Remove Visual Distractions&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>As the saying goes “The mind goes where the eyes wander”. If there are things that might visually stimulate a child, it needs to be removed from the environment of the task. This is why parents are urged not to keep the study table adjacent to a window as the scene outside the window might be distracting. Flashing colours, posters, changing screensavers on computer screens/smartboards etc. are a few visual distractions that can be dealt with in a classroom.<br></p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;<strong>Make the task as fun as possible</strong></li></ul>



<p>A common reason for an attention deficit child to get distracted is the nature of the task. They find it either drab or boring and don’t feel the need to pay attention during the course of the task. Classes cannot stop because of this, but it definitely can have a small twist. Maybe a class conducted outside.&nbsp; A quiz where students compete against each other. A game where everyone gets to participate and the lecture doesn’t feel like a lecture anymore. This keeps students engaged and focussed.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>With <em>QuizNext’s</em> gamified quizzes, children not only get their well-needed practice and revision but also have fun doing it. Users report that they feel they are able to go on for long hours of practice with <em>QuizNext</em> thanks to its fun and user-friendly interface.&nbsp;<br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Fix a routine</strong></li></ul>



<p>This is key to correcting issues in regard to attention and focus. In a fixed routine, there is a designated time for each and everything. That includes important tasks, break times and recreational activities. On knowing that there is a fixed time for everything, children are able to give their one hundred per cent to a task at the specified time. This is a very beneficial way of tackling attention and focus issues.&nbsp;<br></p>



<ul><li><strong>Tailoring lessons/tasks to children’s strengths</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Every child has their own method of learning and understanding things. Some need visual cues like diagrams, flashcards, charts etc. Some need audio cues like shared reading, musical lessons etc. Some need kinaesthetic lessons which enable them to touch and feel their subject matter like application-based projects, dioramas etc. Tailoring the tasks and lessons to the likes of the student makes the student focus on the task with interest.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Set Up a Reward System&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>Studies have shown that at a young age, children tend to work best for incentive. Doesn’t change much when you grow up either, does it? For this simple reason, it is best if a reward system is established before the task begins. The reward could be grand at the end of the task or it could be small rewards at the end of every subtask. It is a very easy and efficient way of making sure the student doesn’t lose focus on their path to earn the rewards.</p>



<p>QuizNext offers practice in the most rewarding way. Along with having fun and amazing gamified quizzes, students really gear up to reap the benefits of topping the leaderboard and are always working hard to maintain their positions.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Embrace the Distractions&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>This might seem to go against the above six points but it is essential to understand this tricky situation. The task we want a child to do is what they need to do. The distraction is what they want to do. It is essential for them to understand they can do whatever they want once they are done with doing what they need to do. For example, after an hour of homework, they could watch T.V. for half an hour. Their distraction could be their reward for their undivided attention during their studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>QuizNext solely believes in the focussed study. After some engaging quizzes and practice sessions, the app advises the user to take a break. This way the student is well rested and can hop back on the app for more gamified fun sessions.</p>



<p>“A child is not a plate to be filled, but a lamp to be lit”. Occasionally the flame of the lamp might waiver but it is the job of the educator to make sure the flame stays lit. As a child gets ready to face the real world, there are many distractions he/she will face and these are a few ways they can learn to keep them focussed.&nbsp;<br></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/parentengagement-1024x571.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1064" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/parentengagement-1024x571.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/parentengagement-300x167.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/parentengagement-768x428.png 768w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/parentengagement.png 1496w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Quiznext Blog: Six truly unique things to teach your kids while working from home</figcaption></figure>



<p>As all of us are staying safe at home, engaging kids throughout the day is becoming a challenge for most. If the kids are younger, there is always colouring, painting and pretend and play. It might not be as simple as we speak, but if you can spare some time and be bit creative you can keep them engaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your child is going to middle school or high&nbsp;school, you have a few more challenges to deal with. Getting them off video calls with their friends or binge-watching videos is a difficult task.&nbsp; To help these parents, we have put together this list to make your life easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Disassemble and Assemble&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>If you ask your kids to clean the&nbsp;bookshelf&nbsp;or wardrobe,&nbsp;its&nbsp;always seen as a punishment or an&nbsp;uninteresting task. Reason being, there is no challenge or there is nothing new&nbsp;to learn.&nbsp;So how do you add more challenge? Ask them to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something that they never expected, like cleaning inside a mixer or&nbsp;table fan wings or anything where it needs few screws to be unscrewed&nbsp;to open. This way you are teaching some basic fixing&nbsp;job and get you a chance to explain/explore the workings of these devices. Word of caution – Make sure you disconnect the cables and read the&nbsp;instruction before opening, as some devices may still have the power stored in capacitors even when they are disconnected.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lifesize drawings, cut-outs</strong></p>



<p>Want to make crafts bit challenging&nbsp;and add some maths?&nbsp;Print&nbsp;any art&nbsp;or&nbsp;silhouette&nbsp;image from&nbsp;internet or pick one from the newspaper or a magazine and ask them to make it life-size or scale-out.&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, one needs to break the image into smaller&nbsp;portions using gridlines and then replicate this on a large sheet&nbsp;or multiple&nbsp;A4 sheets.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1063"/></figure>



<p>Now to&nbsp;accomplish scaling,&nbsp;kids need to&nbsp;learn measurement, reference points and proportions.&nbsp;In the end,&nbsp;this&nbsp;will&nbsp;be a good addition to your home décor.</p>



<p><strong>Play some maths games&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Do you know that most of the kids learn Percentages and ratios by the time they are in 5<sup>th</sup> standard? Ideally, they can calculate GST or Tipping amount in restaurants or discounts.  So, you can ask them some real-world problems with percentages. If you have an old receipt, you can ask them to validate the bill and ask questions like what if GST was 18% instead of 5. Or if we got 30% discount instead of 15%. <em><u>QuizNext app</u></em> offers real-world math problems to solve and gamifies the entire experience. Once they complete the challenges here, you should be asking them if buying 150ML shampoo is more economical or 250ML and how much did we save.</p>



<p><strong>Learn a new language&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>As kids, most of us have made our own language and conversed with our friends. But learning any new language can be equally fun. There are many language learning apps like Duolingo, which makes learning a new language lot easier and fun. If your child can manage to get a friend to sign-up, it will be much more fun. Double the fun by watching some movies in newly learnt language using <u><em><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-party/oocalimimngaihdkbihfgmpkcpnmlaoa?hl=en">Netflix party plugin</a></em></u>. Learning a new language not only boosts the brainpower but also improves the capability to multitask. There are a lot more benefits of learning a new language like improvement of cognitive skills, memory power and get better at understanding your first language as well. </p>



<p><strong>Measure and graph everything&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Data&nbsp;handling concept is something that students are exposed to as early as 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;grade. Now they might have started with apples and marbles problem, now it’s the time to&nbsp;throw&nbsp;some relatable numbers. Ask kids to note electricity meter or water meter&nbsp;daily&nbsp;and&nbsp;arrive at %ge&nbsp;change. If you ask them on why&nbsp;it increased&nbsp;or decrease&nbsp;and drive some root cause analysis, it opens a lot more learning avenues and thereby&nbsp;optimization.&nbsp;If you cannot read the electricity meter,&nbsp;measure your food/milk consumption or&nbsp;even liquid handwash consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Get them to do some research</strong></p>



<p>Let them do some research on your next purchase&nbsp;like a Phone, Mixer, Fridge or AC, this way they will understand the&nbsp;concepts&nbsp;like&nbsp;price, ratings, reviews. They might be doing this already for toys or something they&nbsp;want but&nbsp;doing it on house appliances will help in&nbsp;learning new concepts like&nbsp;specifications&nbsp;and what does it mean.&nbsp;</p>
