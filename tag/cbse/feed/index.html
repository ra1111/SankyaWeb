<h4 id="7cfc">Important insights to fast track exam preparation based on previous years’ CBSE question papers and model&nbsp;papers</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Medium-Post-4-1024x469.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-353" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Medium-Post-4-1024x469.jpg 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Medium-Post-4-300x137.jpg 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Medium-Post-4-768x352.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Board exam season is here! While preparations are in full- swing, a smarter way of preparing could easily put you a step ahead of others in exams. To help you understand what you should be studying and give you an edge over others, we at <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="8" data-gr-id="8">QuizNext,</g> did a deep- dive of the previous years’ board question papers and model question papers to generate key insights such as:</p>



<ul><li>Detailed marks distribution by chapters and how consistent it has been over the years</li><li>Why CBSE publishes the model paper every year and how comparable it is to the final exam papers of respective years?</li><li>Are concepts tested in model question papers and final exam question papers similar?</li></ul>



<p>At the end of the study, we were able to identify three key insights that could fast track any student’s math preparation.</p>



<ul><li>We have identified seven easy chapters that could easily get you first 50 marks in the exam.</li><li>We have identified 30 important concepts that could easily get you 90 percent.</li><li>We have figured out that just solving CBSE Maths model paper will get you 70 percent marks in exams.</li></ul>



<p>Want to see how prepared you are in exams? Get QuizNext app and do a self-assessment.</p>



<h4><strong>Insight 1: Seven easy chapters that could easily get you 50 marks in CBSE Maths Board Exam</strong></h4>



<p>On comparing 2018 Model paper, 2018 main question paper and the 2019 Model paper, we have observed that the chapter-wise split of marks has remained consistent. Further, the chapter-wise marks distribution of all previous year question papers is in line with the unit-wise blueprint prescribed by the board.</p>

<h4>Insight 2: Practicing CBSE Model Question paper thoroughly could easily help you answer 70 percent question in the Board&nbsp;exams</h4>



<p>Yes! That’s right! Based on the analysis of previous years’ question papers, we have seen that there is a very high overlap of questions provided in the Model Questions papers and the questions that have appeared in the Board Exam.</p>



<p>Approximately, 70 percent of the questions in the board exams are exactly similar to the ones asked in the respective year’s model question paper shared by the CBSE board.</p>



<p>Further, in case of other 30 percent of the questions, a question on the parallel concept have been asked form the from the same chapter. Have a look at the question below, that appeared in 2018 Board Exam.</p>



<ul><li>In an AP, if the common difference (d) = –4, and the seventh term (a7) is 4, then find the first term. <strong>(2018 Main Exam Question Paper)</strong></li><li>Find the eleventh term from the last term of the AP: 27, 23, 19,&nbsp;…, –65. <strong>(Sample Question Paper for 2018 Main Exam)</strong></li></ul>

<h3>Insight 3: 30 simple concepts that could get you 90 percent in the final&nbsp;exams</h3>



<p>Now that we were confident about the overlap between Model Question Paper and the Board Question paper in the last 3 years, we wanted to exactly identify important concepts based on the current year’s model question paper, that could help you score highest marks.</p>



<p>We looked at all the questions and identified important concepts that you should be knowing. So based on the analysis, here is a list of 30 concepts out of 82 concepts that will help you score at least 90 percent marks in the board exam.</p>

<p>Board exam season is here! While preparations are on the full- swing, there are students who must be stressed about one subject which is Mathematics. Preparing for the Mathematics exam could be a nightmare for many CBSE Class 10 students. Well, that’s not true! All you should be doing is be smart enough in concepts and chapters that you practice regularly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/QN-MediumBanner.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-350" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/QN-MediumBanner.jpg 1041w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/QN-MediumBanner-300x166.jpg 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/QN-MediumBanner-768x425.jpg 768w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/QN-MediumBanner-1024x567.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1041px) 100vw, 1041px" /></figure>



<p>To make things easy for students, we have done the harder part of what you should be practicing every day. Based on our detailed analysis of we have identified seven chapters that you should be practicing to least 50 out of 80 marks.</p>



<p>So what this means? By just studying 7 out of 15 chapters, students could easily score over 61% marks in the maths CBSE board exam.</p>



<p>Triangles |Introduction to Trigonometry | Arithmetic Progression | Surface Areas and Volumes |Statistics | Real Numbers | Lines</p>

<p>Students forget nearly 40 percent what they study within a day. To retain longer, it requires revision at specific intervals, based on a student’s forgetting curve.</p>



<p>To address this, schools in India follow an academic revision cycle which starts about 30- 45 days before the final exams. However, in reality, when a student revises a chapter in December or say Jan, it is equivalent of studying the chapter for the first time. See a problem?  </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p> <br>Students forget 40% of what they study with 24 hours. Repeating information within 24 hours boosts recall. </p><p></p></blockquote>



<p>Further, when we looked at &#8216;quiz attempted&#8217; data on QuizNext, it was evident that the pattern in which students picked chapters for practice did not help them to retain learning longer. Over 36% students, hardly come back to practice chapters where they performed well or performed badly.</p>



<p>This left us with two insights:</p>



<ul><li>Students do not know what chapters to practice</li><li>Students don’t know how often they should practice a chapter</li></ul>



<p>As a learning app, we knew we wanted to change this ineffective way for revising. So we started to deep- dive and find solutions to this problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, we had already solved a part of this problem i.e. we knew how we could get our users to take up a quiz on a chapter. Gamification elements in the app such as live challenges and school squads have consistently engaged users <em>( more on this in the next post)</em>. </p>



<p>The challenging part was to identify intervals for suggesting revision to students for reducing effects of forgetting curve, which is unique to all students. Further, the rate for recall varies by subjects too. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> For example, a CBSE Class 10 student Riya, might remember a chapter &#8216;Magnetic Effects of Electric Current&#8217; better after 15 days, compared to a chapter &#8216;Acids Bases and Salts&#8217; in Chemistry.  </p></blockquote>



<p>So a predefined &#8216;spaced repetition&#8217; ( Ex: 24 hours, 72 hours, 15 days) would do only half good and would not have delivered what we intended to.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>“Forgetting Curve for students vary, so the time intervals between revision&nbsp;varies”</p></blockquote>



<p>To understand this better, we carried out an intervention. We started sequencing and scheduling quizzes for our ‘active user set’, at cohort level. We wanted to determine primarily two things: </p>



<ul><li>Relationship between quiz performances  and retention index</li><li>Impact on &#8216;Quiz Performance&#8217; with delayed revision cycle </li></ul>



<p>The experiment proved successful when a relationship emerged between ‘quiz performance&#8217; at any point of time and the ‘Retention Index’ with acceptable degree of confidence, at cohort level. With more quiz attempts, Retention Index only got better, giving us confidence to roll it out for all users. Thus Revise+ was created.</p>



<p><strong><em>What is Revise+?</em></strong></p>



<p>Revise+ is an AI based revision scheduling system that considers quiz performances of students for a chapter to decide the right day for revision for that chapter. It determines forgetting curve of students based on subjects, chapter quiz performance, questions exposed and other parameters to schedule revision recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RevisePlusBlog.png" alt="" class="wp-image-291" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RevisePlusBlog.png 826w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RevisePlusBlog-300x179.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RevisePlusBlog-768x458.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" /></figure>



<p>What&#8217;s next?</p>



<p>At the moment, we have been able to recommend chapters at the cohort level, where cohorts are based on ‘chapters practiced’ and student’s overall performance index. It would be interesting to completely personalize these recommendations for every user and also understand the way to achieve this even for new users, from the first attempt.</p>
