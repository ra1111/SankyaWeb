<p>Board exam season is here! While preparations are in full- swing, a smarter way of preparing could easily put you a step ahead of others in exams. To help you understand what you should be studying and give you an edge over others, we at <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="8" data-gr-id="8">QuizNext,</g> did a deep- dive of the previous years’ board question papers and model question papers to generate key insights such as:</p>



<ul><li>Detailed marks distribution by chapters and how consistent it has been over the years</li><li>Why CBSE publishes the model paper every year and how comparable it is to the final exam papers of respective years?</li><li>Are concepts tested in model question papers and final exam question papers similar?</li></ul>



<p>At the end of the study, we were able to identify three key insights that could fast track any student’s math preparation.</p>



<ul><li>We have identified seven easy chapters that could easily get you first 50 marks in the exam.</li><li>We have identified 30 important concepts that could easily get you 90 percent.</li><li>We have figured out that just solving CBSE Maths model paper will get you 70 percent marks in exams.</li></ul>

<h4><strong>Insight 1: Seven easy chapters that could easily get you 50 marks in CBSE Maths Board Exam</strong></h4>



<p>On comparing 2018 Model paper, 2018 main question paper and the 2019 Model paper, we have observed that the chapter-wise split of marks has remained consistent. Further, the chapter-wise marks distribution of all previous year question papers is in line with the unit-wise blueprint prescribed by the board.</p>

<h4>Insight 2: Practicing CBSE Model Question paper thoroughly could easily help you answer 70 percent question in the Board&nbsp;exams</h4>



<p>Yes! That’s right! Based on the analysis of previous years’ question papers, we have seen that there is a very high overlap of questions provided in the Model Questions papers and the questions that have appeared in the Board Exam.</p>



<p>Approximately, 70 percent of the questions in the board exams are exactly similar to the ones asked in the respective year’s model question paper shared by the CBSE board.</p>



<p>Further, in case of other 30 percent of the questions, a question on the parallel concept have been asked form the from the same chapter. Have a look at the question below, that appeared in 2018 Board Exam.</p>



<ul><li>In an AP, if the common difference (d) = –4, and the seventh term (a7) is 4, then find the first term. <strong>(2018 Main Exam Question Paper)</strong></li><li>Find the eleventh term from the last term of the AP: 27, 23, 19,&nbsp;…, –65. <strong>(Sample Question Paper for 2018 Main Exam)</strong></li></ul>

<h3>Insight 3: 30 simple concepts that could get you 90 percent in the final&nbsp;exams</h3>



<p>Now that we were confident about the overlap between Model Question Paper and the Board Question paper in the last 3 years, we wanted to exactly identify important concepts based on the current year’s model question paper, that could help you score highest marks.</p>



<p>We looked at all the questions and identified important concepts that you should be knowing. So based on the analysis, here is a list of 30 concepts out of 82 concepts that will help you score at least 90 percent marks in the board exam.</p>
