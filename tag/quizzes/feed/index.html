<p>COVID has fast-tracked the adoption of technology by schools and teachers. While it&nbsp;hasn’t&nbsp;been easy, teachers have managed to navigate all challenges by smartly adopting various tools and techniques for ensuring uninterrupted learning. ‘Interviews with Educators of the future’ is an interview series we do with different teachers to share the collective insights with the teacher community. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1403" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-300x169.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In this,&nbsp;Chaitanya Naik, Head of Product-&nbsp;QuizNext&nbsp;got into a conversation with&nbsp;<strong>Urvashi&nbsp;Khanolkar, Mathematics teacher at ASPAM Indian International School, Sharjah.</strong>&nbsp;Urvashi&nbsp;Khanolkar&nbsp;has over&nbsp;6&nbsp;years of experience and is also&nbsp;the middle-school coordinator at ASPAM school.  </p>



<p><strong>What are the challenges you uncovered after adopting online classes?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When we shifted to online classes, it was about adapting to the online platforms, understanding the&nbsp;features&nbsp;and functionalities&nbsp;and then creating protocols for online teaching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;we&nbsp;have&nbsp;used&nbsp;technology in classrooms, virtual space is completely different than being in the same room. Students think,&nbsp;behave&nbsp;and understand differently on the online platform and to gauge that gap was a challenge. Reaching and engaging students or even monitoring them to make sure that they are not feeling left out was a challenge. While it isn&#8217;t the same as being in a&nbsp;classroom; over&nbsp;a period of time, we have tried our best to bridge those gaps.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What tools or technology are you using to engage students during&nbsp;online classes?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our LMS is Microsoft Teams, however,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;conducting&nbsp;classes on Zoom, because it is better for visual communication, it helps to have everybody together on one screen via Zoom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I use Padlet to conduct discussions in the class, students share their answers or thoughts on it, then once all the students complete, as a teacher I can approve which answers to share with the rest of the class or give the necessary feedback. This helps in conducting discussions which we would have conducted orally in classrooms. I also use graphic organizers to structure thinking and to make learning more visual.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, break-out rooms on Zoom is a good feature for conducting group discussions and group activities or for assigning different tasks to certain students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have also&nbsp;used&nbsp;other&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;Quiznext,&nbsp;like Quizizz for formative assessment or for post-class validation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What do you think of formative assessments? Can they replace the summative assessments&nbsp;at least&nbsp;for&nbsp;lower grades?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In an online class setup, it is quite difficult to conduct a summative assessment. With online classes being full-time, formative assessments are a better way to conduct assessments. But in the long run, I am not sure. As per the Indian curriculum or examination system, since students are expected to write board exams, we&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;completely do away with summative assessments. As a policy, they might change the format of exam over&nbsp;a period of time, but until then,&nbsp;at least for the higher grades we can’t do away with summative assessments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For lower grades, formative assessments&nbsp;can reduce&nbsp;the pressure and help them focus less on memorizing and more on applying. At our school, we conduct formative assessments every Thursday or when we finish a chapter, whichever is more feasible for teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What aspects of online learning will you carry into classrooms once the&nbsp;lockdown ends?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Our classrooms are equipped with a smartboard, but with online learning, I have&nbsp;realized&nbsp;that&nbsp;technology usage could be increased further to make learning effective. Once we resume regular school, we may introduce BYOD in our classrooms,&nbsp;which can further integrate technology in day-to-day learning.&nbsp;</li><li>Online classes offer transparency and access to resources. For instance, today on MS Teams, my students have access to all my class resources like PowerPoint presentations, notes, assignments and at times, class recordings. Even if&nbsp;someone&nbsp;misses classes, they can pick up from there. Everything is documented and there is transparency. Even if parents want to access them, it is&nbsp;available. This improves overall communication; this is something I would like to continue even after the classes&nbsp;resume&nbsp;as normal.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Lastly, I have realized a lot of work especially assignments can go paperless and could be done with online tools. This could be a good jump especially for Indian curriculum schools on their journey towards paperless classrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Have the teacher communities become more active post COVID? In the US, teacher communities have been active both online and offline, do you see this happening in&nbsp;the&nbsp;ME?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In the Middle East, with respect to teacher communities, I suppose we are somewhere between the US and India. We have a very active teacher community here, but&nbsp;it hasn’t&nbsp;been as prolific as the ones in the US with a big online presence. Even pre-COVID, we would&nbsp;have teacher&nbsp;meetups, workshops and conferences where we would get to interact and learn from other teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But then, we were bound by time and space. Now online webinars have&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;avenues for frequent meetups. Pre- COVID, if there would be meetups once a month, now probably we have one every week. Also, teaching online is a challenge, so people want to talk about it and learn from each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Could&nbsp;you&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us more about the hybrid model that ASPAM Indian International school plans to experiment with?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Starting October ‘20, depending on the situation, we plan to start the hybrid model, where we will have few students come to the school and others learn online. This a small step towards resuming face-to-face classes; it will help the high school students to attend their lab sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;not a mandatory thing, parents have the option of whether to send students to school or not. We conducted a survey with our parent community, there were about 10-15 percent parents per class who were willing to send kids to school. So, we plan to start small and once parents see it working and feel more confident about how we are doing, we expect more parents to start sending their kids to school. Eventually, if there are more students willing to come to school, we will do this on a rotational basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will be teaching with smart boards, that would be streamed over Zoom for students attending classes&nbsp;online.&nbsp;When&nbsp;it comes to activities, we plan to have some&nbsp;hands-on&nbsp;ones for students in the class while&nbsp;those&nbsp;attending online will do them with a web-tool. It is a little bit challenging, but we will adapt to it as we did with online classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Every weekday, Badal wakes up at 5 am, revises what he studied in school and cooks breakfast, before leaving for school at 8 am. Badal attends a private school where tuition fees are Rs. 1,000 per month. He says that he studies religiously to avoid punishment at school.</p>
<p id="624a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His mother passed away when he was little, and his father works in Rajasthan. Badal and his younger sister<span>&nbsp;</span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Riddhi</em>, live with their aunt, largely responsible for themselves.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Who helps Badal study? The internet!</strong></p>
<p id="7f8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Badal has a 4G enabled smartphone. He searches for resources and bookmarks good sites. He likes videos that explain concepts. When he is looking for solutions to specific problems from his textbook or explanations of whole chapters, the internet is always up to the task.</p>
<p id="d40a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recently, Badal started using<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vidyanext.quiznext&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dmedium%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_term%3DDriving_EdTech%26utm_campaign%3DTierII_III_Cities" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vidyanext.quiznext"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">QuizNext</em></strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">,<span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong>a gamified revision app that allows CBSE and ICSE students revise any concept in Maths &amp; Science. Badal uses QuizNext to check his understanding. As soon as he finishes studying a chapter, he takes a quiz to assess his gaps.</p>
<p id="ab26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When he discovered the benefits of this revision app, he asked Riddhi to join too. For every quiz they attempted they earned points. Badal and Riddhi became such avid QuizNexters that they both earned spots in our top 10 players!</p>
<blockquote id="5333" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><p>“Quizzing helps me revise what is taught in school and assesses my understanding of a&nbsp;chapter”</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="3098" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote"><strong>Tier II and Tier III&nbsp;cities</strong></h3>
<p id="179b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Badal and Riddhi’s story is not unique. About 64.09 percent of QuizNext users are from tier II and smaller cities and towns in India. As the Indian 4G internet boom has grown, tier II and tier III cities are being connected. As of June 2018, according to<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.telecomlead.com/4g-lte/most-of-rural-india-yet-to-experience-4g-data-services-86750" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="https://www.telecomlead.com/4g-lte/most-of-rural-india-yet-to-experience-4g-data-services-86750">Telecom Lead</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and TRAI, 51.6 CR users or 44.16% of 4G subscribers were from outside urban metros.</p>
<p id="fd02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nearly 82% of QuizNext users are on a 4G network and do not have a WiFi connection. It is exciting to see users from Bulandshehar, Rajapalayam, Muzaffarnagar, Kolar and other smaller towns. The Indian 4G internet boom has helped us reach a demographic we never thought possible!</p>
<blockquote id="9d10" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><p>About 64.09 percent of QuizNext users are from tier II and other smaller towns; nearly 82% of our users do not have a WiFi connection</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="7ef8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Children Today have Increased Agency</h4>
<p id="3fa7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Students today do not rely just on textbooks or refreshers at a bookstore. With the average number of mobile phones in a household increasing to 2, they have more access to mobile phones. Secondary devices at home is helping students to use technology for study needs.</p>
<blockquote id="fb7f" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><p>Nearly 72.5% of QuizNext users have the app installed on their mother’s phone or a secondary device at&nbsp;home.</p></blockquote>
<p id="5d61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Further, instead of looking to their parents to download apps and search for useful educational resources, students proactively scour the internet for solutions and solved question papers.</p>
<p id="9526" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">About 65 percent of times, students themselves discovered the app and downloaded it, while in other cases it was downloaded either by their parents or siblings.</p>
<h3 id="bac8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong>Feedback</strong></h3>
<p id="7c8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We found, in school delayed feedback and its lack of personalization decelerates student progress. Exam results are only known after few weeks. By which time, students have moved on to another chapter in their course or have forgotten what they studied. As for parents, a term-wise report card is a simplistic reflection of marks the student scored with very little feedback on how to improve.</p>
<p id="2fe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For students and parents, QuizNext has broken this cycle. QuizNext’s instant feedback helps students self-assess. It shows them which chapters need more practice. Our monthly leaderboard is very popular among our users. Students can match their progress with those across the country.</p>
<p id="c858" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Practice” and “Challenge” are the two ways in which students can take a quiz on the app. Challenges, where students can add their friends or play with a random opponent is the preferred option showing us that social learning added an element of fun to revision. Game elements within the app has hooked users on to QuizNext, as students prefer Challenge quizzes over solo Practice quizzes. In addition, QuizNext’s instant feedback helps students self-assess. It shows them which chapters need more practice. Plus, when doing challenges, it shows each students’ ranking and competitive performance.</p>
<blockquote id="f9bd" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><p>Game elements within the app has hooked students on to revising chapters with QuizNext. Nearly 68.5% of quizzes taken are challenges quizzes against random opponents.</p></blockquote>
<p id="adba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">In school, the study goals are spaced out over months, making it difficult for students to remain focused throughout the year. QuizNext’s 5 minute quiz helps them channel energy and focus on a goal that is time bound and placed in a short time span.</p>
<p id="e499" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are currently no apps or solutions in the market that help students revise effectively. We are happy to be building something that is pioneering the way in helping students’ study through revision.</p>
