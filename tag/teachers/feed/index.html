<p>COVID has fast-tracked the adoption of technology by schools and teachers. While it&nbsp;hasn’t&nbsp;been easy, teachers have managed to navigate all challenges by smartly adopting various tools and techniques for ensuring uninterrupted learning. ‘Interviews with Educators of the future’ is an interview series we do with different teachers to share the collective insights with the teacher community. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1403" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-300x169.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In this,&nbsp;Chaitanya Naik, Head of Product-&nbsp;QuizNext&nbsp;got into a conversation with&nbsp;<strong>Urvashi&nbsp;Khanolkar, Mathematics teacher at ASPAM Indian International School, Sharjah.</strong>&nbsp;Urvashi&nbsp;Khanolkar&nbsp;has over&nbsp;6&nbsp;years of experience and is also&nbsp;the middle-school coordinator at ASPAM school.  </p>



<p><strong>What are the challenges you uncovered after adopting online classes?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When we shifted to online classes, it was about adapting to the online platforms, understanding the&nbsp;features&nbsp;and functionalities&nbsp;and then creating protocols for online teaching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;we&nbsp;have&nbsp;used&nbsp;technology in classrooms, virtual space is completely different than being in the same room. Students think,&nbsp;behave&nbsp;and understand differently on the online platform and to gauge that gap was a challenge. Reaching and engaging students or even monitoring them to make sure that they are not feeling left out was a challenge. While it isn&#8217;t the same as being in a&nbsp;classroom; over&nbsp;a period of time, we have tried our best to bridge those gaps.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What tools or technology are you using to engage students during&nbsp;online classes?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our LMS is Microsoft Teams, however,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;conducting&nbsp;classes on Zoom, because it is better for visual communication, it helps to have everybody together on one screen via Zoom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I use Padlet to conduct discussions in the class, students share their answers or thoughts on it, then once all the students complete, as a teacher I can approve which answers to share with the rest of the class or give the necessary feedback. This helps in conducting discussions which we would have conducted orally in classrooms. I also use graphic organizers to structure thinking and to make learning more visual.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, break-out rooms on Zoom is a good feature for conducting group discussions and group activities or for assigning different tasks to certain students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have also&nbsp;used&nbsp;other&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;Quiznext,&nbsp;like Quizizz for formative assessment or for post-class validation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What do you think of formative assessments? Can they replace the summative assessments&nbsp;at least&nbsp;for&nbsp;lower grades?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In an online class setup, it is quite difficult to conduct a summative assessment. With online classes being full-time, formative assessments are a better way to conduct assessments. But in the long run, I am not sure. As per the Indian curriculum or examination system, since students are expected to write board exams, we&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;completely do away with summative assessments. As a policy, they might change the format of exam over&nbsp;a period of time, but until then,&nbsp;at least for the higher grades we can’t do away with summative assessments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For lower grades, formative assessments&nbsp;can reduce&nbsp;the pressure and help them focus less on memorizing and more on applying. At our school, we conduct formative assessments every Thursday or when we finish a chapter, whichever is more feasible for teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What aspects of online learning will you carry into classrooms once the&nbsp;lockdown ends?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Our classrooms are equipped with a smartboard, but with online learning, I have&nbsp;realized&nbsp;that&nbsp;technology usage could be increased further to make learning effective. Once we resume regular school, we may introduce BYOD in our classrooms,&nbsp;which can further integrate technology in day-to-day learning.&nbsp;</li><li>Online classes offer transparency and access to resources. For instance, today on MS Teams, my students have access to all my class resources like PowerPoint presentations, notes, assignments and at times, class recordings. Even if&nbsp;someone&nbsp;misses classes, they can pick up from there. Everything is documented and there is transparency. Even if parents want to access them, it is&nbsp;available. This improves overall communication; this is something I would like to continue even after the classes&nbsp;resume&nbsp;as normal.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Lastly, I have realized a lot of work especially assignments can go paperless and could be done with online tools. This could be a good jump especially for Indian curriculum schools on their journey towards paperless classrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Have the teacher communities become more active post COVID? In the US, teacher communities have been active both online and offline, do you see this happening in&nbsp;the&nbsp;ME?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In the Middle East, with respect to teacher communities, I suppose we are somewhere between the US and India. We have a very active teacher community here, but&nbsp;it hasn’t&nbsp;been as prolific as the ones in the US with a big online presence. Even pre-COVID, we would&nbsp;have teacher&nbsp;meetups, workshops and conferences where we would get to interact and learn from other teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But then, we were bound by time and space. Now online webinars have&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;avenues for frequent meetups. Pre- COVID, if there would be meetups once a month, now probably we have one every week. Also, teaching online is a challenge, so people want to talk about it and learn from each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Could&nbsp;you&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us more about the hybrid model that ASPAM Indian International school plans to experiment with?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Starting October ‘20, depending on the situation, we plan to start the hybrid model, where we will have few students come to the school and others learn online. This a small step towards resuming face-to-face classes; it will help the high school students to attend their lab sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;not a mandatory thing, parents have the option of whether to send students to school or not. We conducted a survey with our parent community, there were about 10-15 percent parents per class who were willing to send kids to school. So, we plan to start small and once parents see it working and feel more confident about how we are doing, we expect more parents to start sending their kids to school. Eventually, if there are more students willing to come to school, we will do this on a rotational basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will be teaching with smart boards, that would be streamed over Zoom for students attending classes&nbsp;online.&nbsp;When&nbsp;it comes to activities, we plan to have some&nbsp;hands-on&nbsp;ones for students in the class while&nbsp;those&nbsp;attending online will do them with a web-tool. It is a little bit challenging, but we will adapt to it as we did with online classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The year 2020 will be etched in history as the “Online Educational Era”. As idealistic as it sounds, it comes with its own comebacks. It has been a huge change to get used to and we at QuizNext were curious to know how our users were adapting to the present conditions. Chaitanya Naik, Head of Product- QuizNext got into a telephonic conversation with two educators who have used QuizNext and benefited positively.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava,</strong> Principal of Sahu International School, is a Biology teacher who has over twenty-two years of experience teaching classes nine and ten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our second interviewee was <strong>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop</strong> from the Chemistry Department in Sushila Birla Girls School, Kolkata who has over fifteen years of experience in her field of education.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong><em>If you look at your 1st day of online classes to today what changes have you seen?</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava: “<em>The first day was quite an anxious day for teachers and students. Web Cameras, screen sharing, managing noises in multiple environments were some of the problems we had initially. Now as time has passed we have gotten in the flow of things. As teachers, we discuss how we can explain things in a better manner and engage children online. Now when we look back, these issues were quite trivia</em>l”.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop: “<em>Initially classes were quite chaotic. Now they are much more organized and settled in. Students also learned to accept the changed way of teaching. They have adopted the new learning processes and now enjoy the class and the different methods used and parents also have opened up for all required help</em>”.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong><em>What are the challenges you uncovered after adopting online classes?</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava: “<em>I personally have almost 22 years experience teaching in a classroom. It was very hard for myself and other faculty members to replicate our classroom teaching. Normally in a classroom, we are able to read the faces and body language of children and figure out if they are paying attention or not. Sometimes in online classes, we may be speaking for 10-15 minutes straight. By the end of the class, we feel alone. In order to make sure students are listening all the way, we conduct a test by the end of the class. In this aspect, QuizNext has helped a lot. The results of online classes were turning up very disappointing. With QuizNext, we were able to get ready-made Quizzes on the topics we just covered and put the student’s knowledge to the test.</em>”<br></p>



<p>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop: “<em>Extensive use of technology, discovering new ways to engage students and maintaining their interest in the topic, managing parents and adopting the changing rules of the board about conducting online classes. These are just a few of the changes we had to come around since online classes began</em>”.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think formative assessment can replace exams this year?&nbsp;</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava: “<em>I am not certain about it. Teachers like it. Students like it. It gives a clearer image of the student’s knowledge. It took a while though. We started off slow and now we conduct 3-5 quizzes on each chapter with Quiznext. Formative Assessments are reliable for giving students all year round engagement to their studies. Replacing final exams might be too big a change right now. Even NEP 2020 is going for a similar system. So we will have to wait and watch</em>”.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop: “<em>Maybe. Formative assessments definitely have their own way of testing the talents of children. The future will be bright for those students who can apply their knowledge and not just who gather the information</em>”.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>What aspects of online learning will you carry into classrooms once the lockdown ends?</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava: “<em>We started off using technology due to compulsion. There wasn’t any other way. Now we see the benefits of it. The quizzes, videos and content has definitely been beneficial for students after classes. Since children are actively participating in it, we will continue to adopt the benefits of technology further. We will continue using QuizNext even after school is opened for daily formative assessment</em>”.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop: “<em>Online quizzes, sharing relevant videos, online examination as it is the upcoming trend and of course , the webinars. These are a few of the features we will carry into the offline mode of learning as well</em>”.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong><em>Now that you are not seeing students in person, what has changed for you in terms of bond/connection with students?</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Mrs. Sunita Srivastava: “<em>We all teachers share a special bond with our students. To the point where children listen to us more than their parents. Even though we don&#8217;t see each other physically, we managed to maintain that bond. We exchange WhatsApp messages. Students ask more questions offline. Being at home, when online classes happen, students treat us teachers like guests in their home. In the first video call with the students, I could see the joy on their face. They were excited to see us after their long break. We are quite excited to see them after the lockdown is lifted. I am sure that day will be emotional for the staff. We miss talking to the parents as well</em>”.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Amrita Gaur Swaroop: “<em>Nothing in terms of bond has really changed. This generation is more open on an online platform than they are personally. This period gave us an opportunity to come onto the same platform and realise their way of thinking and expressing. It has really brought us closer. In my last 15 years of teaching experience, it was always that I had just one or two students contact number or email id of class 12 for any communication or information sharing. But this year not of only class 12 , I have contact numbers, WhatsApp numbers and email ids of all my students right from class 6 to 12.</em>”<br></p>



<p>While the online era might have its drawbacks, we have to try and make the best out of the present situation and find what is best for the future of the coming generations of children.The pandemic might have been a step back but adapting to the present situation will be taking two steps forward. <br></p>
