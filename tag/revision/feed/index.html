<p>Students forget nearly 40 percent what they study within a day. To retain longer, it requires revision at specific intervals, based on a student’s forgetting curve.</p>



<p>To address this, schools in India follow an academic revision cycle which starts about 30- 45 days before the final exams. However, in reality, when a student revises a chapter in December or say Jan, it is equivalent of studying the chapter for the first time. See a problem?  </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p> <br>Students forget 40% of what they study with 24 hours. Repeating information within 24 hours boosts recall. </p><p></p></blockquote>



<p>Further, when we looked at &#8216;quiz attempted&#8217; data on QuizNext, it was evident that the pattern in which students picked chapters for practice did not help them to retain learning longer. Over 36% students, hardly come back to practice chapters where they performed well or performed badly.</p>



<p>This left us with two insights:</p>



<ul><li>Students do not know what chapters to practice</li><li>Students don’t know how often they should practice a chapter</li></ul>



<p>As a learning app, we knew we wanted to change this ineffective way for revising. So we started to deep- dive and find solutions to this problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, we had already solved a part of this problem i.e. we knew how we could get our users to take up a quiz on a chapter. Gamification elements in the app such as live challenges and school squads have consistently engaged users <em>( more on this in the next post)</em>. </p>



<p>The challenging part was to identify intervals for suggesting revision to students for reducing effects of forgetting curve, which is unique to all students. Further, the rate for recall varies by subjects too. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> For example, a CBSE Class 10 student Riya, might remember a chapter &#8216;Magnetic Effects of Electric Current&#8217; better after 15 days, compared to a chapter &#8216;Acids Bases and Salts&#8217; in Chemistry.  </p></blockquote>



<p>So a predefined &#8216;spaced repetition&#8217; ( Ex: 24 hours, 72 hours, 15 days) would do only half good and would not have delivered what we intended to.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>“Forgetting Curve for students vary, so the time intervals between revision&nbsp;varies”</p></blockquote>



<p>To understand this better, we carried out an intervention. We started sequencing and scheduling quizzes for our ‘active user set’, at cohort level. We wanted to determine primarily two things: </p>



<ul><li>Relationship between quiz performances  and retention index</li><li>Impact on &#8216;Quiz Performance&#8217; with delayed revision cycle </li></ul>



<p>The experiment proved successful when a relationship emerged between ‘quiz performance&#8217; at any point of time and the ‘Retention Index’ with acceptable degree of confidence, at cohort level. With more quiz attempts, Retention Index only got better, giving us confidence to roll it out for all users. Thus Revise+ was created.</p>



<p><strong><em>What is Revise+?</em></strong></p>



<p>Revise+ is an AI based revision scheduling system that considers quiz performances of students for a chapter to decide the right day for revision for that chapter. It determines forgetting curve of students based on subjects, chapter quiz performance, questions exposed and other parameters to schedule revision recommendations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&#8217;s next?</p>



<p>At the moment, we have been able to recommend chapters at the cohort level, where cohorts are based on ‘chapters practiced’ and student’s overall performance index. It would be interesting to completely personalize these recommendations for every user and also understand the way to achieve this even for new users, from the first attempt.</p>

Every weekday, Badal wakes up at 5 am, revises what he studied in school and cooks breakfast, before leaving for school at 8 am. Badal attends a private school where tuition fees are Rs. 1,000 per month. He says that he studies religiously to avoid punishment at school.</p>
<p id="624a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His mother passed away when he was little, and his father works in Rajasthan. Badal and his younger sister<span>&nbsp;</span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Riddhi</em>, live with their aunt, largely responsible for themselves.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Who helps Badal study? The internet!</strong></p>
<p id="7f8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Badal has a 4G enabled smartphone. He searches for resources and bookmarks good sites. He likes videos that explain concepts. When he is looking for solutions to specific problems from his textbook or explanations of whole chapters, the internet is always up to the task.</p>
<p id="d40a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recently, Badal started using<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vidyanext.quiznext&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dmedium%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_term%3DDriving_EdTech%26utm_campaign%3DTierII_III_Cities" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vidyanext.quiznext"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">QuizNext</em></strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">,<span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong>a gamified revision app that allows CBSE and ICSE students revise any concept in Maths &amp; Science. Badal uses QuizNext to check his understanding. As soon as he finishes studying a chapter, he takes a quiz to assess his gaps.</p>
<p id="ab26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When he discovered the benefits of this revision app, he asked Riddhi to join too. For every quiz they attempted they earned points. Badal and Riddhi became such avid QuizNexters that they both earned spots in our top 10 players!</p>
<blockquote id="5333" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><p>“Quizzing helps me revise what is taught in school and assesses my understanding of a&nbsp;chapter”</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="3098" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote"><strong>Tier II and Tier III&nbsp;cities</strong></h3>
<p id="179b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Badal and Riddhi’s story is not unique. About 64.09 percent of QuizNext users are from tier II and smaller cities and towns in India. As the Indian 4G internet boom has grown, tier II and tier III cities are being connected. As of June 2018, according to<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.telecomlead.com/4g-lte/most-of-rural-india-yet-to-experience-4g-data-services-86750" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="https://www.telecomlead.com/4g-lte/most-of-rural-india-yet-to-experience-4g-data-services-86750">Telecom Lead</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and TRAI, 51.6 CR users or 44.16% of 4G subscribers were from outside urban metros.</p>
<p id="fd02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nearly 82% of QuizNext users are on a 4G network and do not have a WiFi connection. It is exciting to see users from Bulandshehar, Rajapalayam, Muzaffarnagar, Kolar and other smaller towns. The Indian 4G internet boom has helped us reach a demographic we never thought possible!</p>
<blockquote id="9d10" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><p>About 64.09 percent of QuizNext users are from tier II and other smaller towns; nearly 82% of our users do not have a WiFi connection</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="7ef8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Children Today have Increased Agency</h4>
<p id="3fa7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Students today do not rely just on textbooks or refreshers at a bookstore. With the average number of mobile phones in a household increasing to 2, they have more access to mobile phones. Secondary devices at home is helping students to use technology for study needs.</p>
<blockquote id="fb7f" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><p>Nearly 72.5% of QuizNext users have the app installed on their mother’s phone or a secondary device at&nbsp;home.</p></blockquote>
<p id="5d61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Further, instead of looking to their parents to download apps and search for useful educational resources, students proactively scour the internet for solutions and solved question papers.</p>
<p id="9526" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">About 65 percent of times, students themselves discovered the app and downloaded it, while in other cases it was downloaded either by their parents or siblings.</p>
<h3 id="bac8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong>Feedback</strong></h3>
<p id="7c8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We found, in school delayed feedback and its lack of personalization decelerates student progress. Exam results are only known after few weeks. By which time, students have moved on to another chapter in their course or have forgotten what they studied. As for parents, a term-wise report card is a simplistic reflection of marks the student scored with very little feedback on how to improve.</p>
<p id="2fe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For students and parents, QuizNext has broken this cycle. QuizNext’s instant feedback helps students self-assess. It shows them which chapters need more practice. Our monthly leaderboard is very popular among our users. Students can match their progress with those across the country.</p>
<p id="c858" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Practice” and “Challenge” are the two ways in which students can take a quiz on the app. Challenges, where students can add their friends or play with a random opponent is the preferred option showing us that social learning added an element of fun to revision. Game elements within the app has hooked users on to QuizNext, as students prefer Challenge quizzes over solo Practice quizzes. In addition, QuizNext’s instant feedback helps students self-assess. It shows them which chapters need more practice. Plus, when doing challenges, it shows each students’ ranking and competitive performance.</p>
<blockquote id="f9bd" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><p>Game elements within the app has hooked students on to revising chapters with QuizNext. Nearly 68.5% of quizzes taken are challenges quizzes against random opponents.</p></blockquote>
<p id="adba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">In school, the study goals are spaced out over months, making it difficult for students to remain focused throughout the year. QuizNext’s 5 minute quiz helps them channel energy and focus on a goal that is time bound and placed in a short time span.</p>
<p id="e499" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are currently no apps or solutions in the market that help students revise effectively. We are happy to be building something that is pioneering the way in helping students’ study through revision.</p>
