<p>COVID has fast-tracked the adoption of technology by schools and teachers. While it&nbsp;hasn’t&nbsp;been easy, teachers have managed to navigate all challenges by smartly adopting various tools and techniques for ensuring uninterrupted learning. ‘Interviews with Educators of the future’ is an interview series we do with different teachers to share the collective insights with the teacher community. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1403" srcset="https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-300x169.png 300w, https://quiznext.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TeacherInterviews-4-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In this,&nbsp;Chaitanya Naik, Head of Product-&nbsp;QuizNext&nbsp;got into a conversation with&nbsp;<strong>Urvashi&nbsp;Khanolkar, Mathematics teacher at ASPAM Indian International School, Sharjah.</strong>&nbsp;Urvashi&nbsp;Khanolkar&nbsp;has over&nbsp;6&nbsp;years of experience and is also&nbsp;the middle-school coordinator at ASPAM school.  </p>



<p><strong>What are the challenges you uncovered after adopting online classes?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When we shifted to online classes, it was about adapting to the online platforms, understanding the&nbsp;features&nbsp;and functionalities&nbsp;and then creating protocols for online teaching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;we&nbsp;have&nbsp;used&nbsp;technology in classrooms, virtual space is completely different than being in the same room. Students think,&nbsp;behave&nbsp;and understand differently on the online platform and to gauge that gap was a challenge. Reaching and engaging students or even monitoring them to make sure that they are not feeling left out was a challenge. While it isn&#8217;t the same as being in a&nbsp;classroom; over&nbsp;a period of time, we have tried our best to bridge those gaps.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What tools or technology are you using to engage students during&nbsp;online classes?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our LMS is Microsoft Teams, however,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;conducting&nbsp;classes on Zoom, because it is better for visual communication, it helps to have everybody together on one screen via Zoom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I use Padlet to conduct discussions in the class, students share their answers or thoughts on it, then once all the students complete, as a teacher I can approve which answers to share with the rest of the class or give the necessary feedback. This helps in conducting discussions which we would have conducted orally in classrooms. I also use graphic organizers to structure thinking and to make learning more visual.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, break-out rooms on Zoom is a good feature for conducting group discussions and group activities or for assigning different tasks to certain students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have also&nbsp;used&nbsp;other&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;Quiznext,&nbsp;like Quizizz for formative assessment or for post-class validation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What do you think of formative assessments? Can they replace the summative assessments&nbsp;at least&nbsp;for&nbsp;lower grades?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In an online class setup, it is quite difficult to conduct a summative assessment. With online classes being full-time, formative assessments are a better way to conduct assessments. But in the long run, I am not sure. As per the Indian curriculum or examination system, since students are expected to write board exams, we&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;completely do away with summative assessments. As a policy, they might change the format of exam over&nbsp;a period of time, but until then,&nbsp;at least for the higher grades we can’t do away with summative assessments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For lower grades, formative assessments&nbsp;can reduce&nbsp;the pressure and help them focus less on memorizing and more on applying. At our school, we conduct formative assessments every Thursday or when we finish a chapter, whichever is more feasible for teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What aspects of online learning will you carry into classrooms once the&nbsp;lockdown ends?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Our classrooms are equipped with a smartboard, but with online learning, I have&nbsp;realized&nbsp;that&nbsp;technology usage could be increased further to make learning effective. Once we resume regular school, we may introduce BYOD in our classrooms,&nbsp;which can further integrate technology in day-to-day learning.&nbsp;</li><li>Online classes offer transparency and access to resources. For instance, today on MS Teams, my students have access to all my class resources like PowerPoint presentations, notes, assignments and at times, class recordings. Even if&nbsp;someone&nbsp;misses classes, they can pick up from there. Everything is documented and there is transparency. Even if parents want to access them, it is&nbsp;available. This improves overall communication; this is something I would like to continue even after the classes&nbsp;resume&nbsp;as normal.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Lastly, I have realized a lot of work especially assignments can go paperless and could be done with online tools. This could be a good jump especially for Indian curriculum schools on their journey towards paperless classrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Have the teacher communities become more active post COVID? In the US, teacher communities have been active both online and offline, do you see this happening in&nbsp;the&nbsp;ME?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In the Middle East, with respect to teacher communities, I suppose we are somewhere between the US and India. We have a very active teacher community here, but&nbsp;it hasn’t&nbsp;been as prolific as the ones in the US with a big online presence. Even pre-COVID, we would&nbsp;have teacher&nbsp;meetups, workshops and conferences where we would get to interact and learn from other teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But then, we were bound by time and space. Now online webinars have&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;avenues for frequent meetups. Pre- COVID, if there would be meetups once a month, now probably we have one every week. Also, teaching online is a challenge, so people want to talk about it and learn from each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Could&nbsp;you&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us more about the hybrid model that ASPAM Indian International school plans to experiment with?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Starting October ‘20, depending on the situation, we plan to start the hybrid model, where we will have few students come to the school and others learn online. This a small step towards resuming face-to-face classes; it will help the high school students to attend their lab sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;not a mandatory thing, parents have the option of whether to send students to school or not. We conducted a survey with our parent community, there were about 10-15 percent parents per class who were willing to send kids to school. So, we plan to start small and once parents see it working and feel more confident about how we are doing, we expect more parents to start sending their kids to school. Eventually, if there are more students willing to come to school, we will do this on a rotational basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will be teaching with smart boards, that would be streamed over Zoom for students attending classes&nbsp;online.&nbsp;When&nbsp;it comes to activities, we plan to have some&nbsp;hands-on&nbsp;ones for students in the class while&nbsp;those&nbsp;attending online will do them with a web-tool. It is a little bit challenging, but we will adapt to it as we did with online classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>My two girls, Aarah (7 years) and Saraah (5 years), hate drinking milk but I know a way to get them to do it, as I know it’s good for them. When I say, “Let’s see who finishes the glass first?”, the glass is empty within a flash. This is not just me, I am sure all parents do this. These things make it easy to motivate kids to do things they dislike.</p>



<p>The pleasure of winning isn’t just a great motivator for kids, but adults too. Last weekend, I discovered from my colleague that to top the ‘Step Tracking Weekly Leader board’ amongst her friends, she paced up and down her living room just before midnight, when the leader board resets. Don’t you agree that a small competition and the pleasure of winning, has even motivated a person in her mid-thirties to walk more?</p>



<p>So, here’s the big question — what gets my daughters and my colleague to complete these smaller tasks which they generally don’t like? What is it that gets them to accomplish a broader objective, in this case, a ‘Healthier Diet’ and ‘Physical Fitness’ respectively, with smaller milestones?</p>



<p>The answer is Gamification!</p>



<p><strong><em>Gamification</em></strong>&nbsp;refers to the use of game design and elements in a non-gaming context to drive the desired behavior. In simpler terms, it is about using the system of points, levels, badges, or leaderboards that are common in games, in real-world scenarios.</p>



<p>Doesn’t it make a perfect case for gamification to be used in learning to make it fun and effective?</p>



<p>It does! However, learning methods at school or even at home, face a huge engagement crisis today. The learning of today only involves learning by rote and then producing those in the exams, causing boredom among young learners. According to a Labster study, about 60 percent of students mentioned that they love Science, however, only 24 percent among them, said that they love Science classes. See the difference? When a parent can get a child to drink milk with gaming principles, why shouldn’t parents and teachers use the same method to impart learning to kids?</p>



<p>Ed-tech startups have identified this need, which is why online learning tools such as Khan Academy, Quizizz and our own app,&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2UaLMwI" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">QuizNex</a>t have started using game elements to deliver learning objectives to students. At QuizNext, we are focused at gamifying the revision experience for CBSE and ICSE students by providing detailed chapter-wise quizzes for delivering formative assessments, making practice fun and engaging.</p>



<p>It offers two types of revision quizzes:</p>



<p>-Practice Quizzes, which are chapter-wise solo quizzes</p>



<p>-Challenge Quizzes, where students compete against other online users on different chapters and concepts</p>



<p>So, which one do you think has more adoption among kids? Challenge Quizzes? Are you sure? You are right, but not completely! I will come to that shortly!</p>



<p>Just going by the numbers, ‘Challenge Quizzes’ completely outnumber the ‘Practice Quizzes’, accounting for about 68% of the 300,000 quizzes taken over on QuizNext over the last five months. However, it is interesting to see the pattern in which students take quizzes. Students first take ‘Practice Quizzes’, ensure that they have understood the concepts before they go on to challenge their friends in ‘Challenge Quizzes’.</p>



<p>Further, it has been interesting to see students expect stronger opponents in Challenge Quizzes. In the initial versions of the app, we would randomly pick opponents (both real users and Bots) in Challenge Quizzes. When the learners got used to winning every time, mostly against Bots, they would ‘leave feedback’ asking if they could choose opponents on own including friends.</p>



<p><strong>So why does this work?</strong></p>



<p>To understand this a little bit better, let us understand how&nbsp;<strong>Intrinsic Reinforcement</strong>&nbsp;works. Whenever you challenge yourself, however big or small, and complete that challenge, the brain releases a chemical called dopamine, which is a pleasurable chemical that makes the challenge achievement feel good.</p>



<p>Further, the more you do this i.e. the&nbsp;<strong>challenge — achievement- pleasure loop</strong>&nbsp;occurs more often, the brain secretes more dopamine and testosterone, making you want to do it repeatedly and succeed, which is also called the&nbsp;<strong>Winning Effect</strong>. So, in a student’s context, winning a Challenge Quiz after a stiff competition creates a good feeling and further motivates them to take more quizzes, to replicate the Winning Effect every time.</p>



<p>We’re constantly observing our users’ activities on QuizNext to derive insights on what works and what doesn’t. Here’s what we’ve learnt so far about Gamification:</p>



<p>• Recognition motivates learners to practice more: Learners who have been among Top 15 positions on the leader board, take nine times the number of quizzes every week, when compared to other users.</p>



<p>• Virtual Badges and Points trigger intrinsic motivations: Though badges and points have no financial value, it motivates some learners to earn and accumulate them. We ran an experiment, where 50 percent of a ‘user subset’ were offered additional coins for completing practice quizzes, while the other 50 percent of the user set were offered no additional incentives. At the end of the experiment, the user group which had additional incentives had completed 24 percent more quizzes than the other group.</p>



<p>• Extrinsic triggers drive learning: Triggers such as ‘Challenge Invites’ work exceptionally well with some set of users. Grouping users based on learning objectives and placing them against each other for a challenge gets users to complete quizzes and move closer to learning objectives.</p>



<p>• Breaking a larger goal into smaller milestones makes learning less overwhelming: Breaking down a chapter or concept into smaller quizzes, keeps students motivated as they can earn rewards for every quiz and work with smaller bits of information.</p>



<p>• Time-bound quizzes improve student performances: We have seen that time bound quiz improves the speed of students by at least 50 percent while maintaining the same accuracy levels for questions of similar difficulty and understanding levels for concepts.</p>



<p>With these insights, it’s safe to say that Gamification might hold the key to a world of a better education that’s been locked behind books for many parents and kids for a long time now.</p>
